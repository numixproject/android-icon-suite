# Android Icon Themes

We used to package our [Circle](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-circle) and [Square](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-square) icons themes for Android alongside [Hexagon](https://github.com/numixproject/android-icon-suite/tree/master/com.numix.icons_hexagon), another vibrant theme, and [Fold](https://github.com/numixproject/android-icon-suite/tree/master/com.numix.icons_fold), a forray into pastel themes. The Android packaging was largely developed by [@paolorotolo](https://github.com/paolorotolo) and the icons largely designed by [@me4oslav](https://github.com/me4oslav). These themes can still be built with [Numix Core](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-core) but the Android packaging itself (including the icon request app) is no longer maintained due to lack of developer time.

If you're interested in taking up maintainance of these theme please [get in touch](mailto:numixproject@gmail.com).
